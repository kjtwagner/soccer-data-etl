# Soccer Competition Data Pipeline

This project implements an ETL pipeline that ingests season-long small-sided soccer competition data from Excel and loads it into a normalized relational database for analysis.

## Data
The source data consists of manually tracked practice-level game results, including randomized teams, player participation, goals scored, and attendance-based point adjustments.

## Tech Stack
- Python (pandas)
- SQL (PostgreSQL)
- GitHub Projects for task tracking?

## Project Status
Schema design and data audit in progress.
